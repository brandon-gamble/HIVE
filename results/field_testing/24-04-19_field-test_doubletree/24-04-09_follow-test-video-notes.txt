24-04-19 notes on field test recordings 
test at doubletree culvert, 30" concrete round

9x16	too bright, doesn't follow - adjust follower flashlight midway
	backup goes sideways

9x59	1:18 setup
	slow driving, poor tracking
	back up into follower

9x36	cut test short

9x20	follow a little jerky
	good video panning of leader -> demonstrates glare effect (see note)
	good backup

9x45	tried to drive really fast away but follower kept up for most of it
	good backup sequence
	1:50 second chase

9x37	video transmission dist test - made it to end of 50' tagline easily
	video freezes at end of test when tank has returned

	


notes:
- noticed that when marker is perpendicular to flashlight there is a glare that makes it difficult to detect. when turret is turned slightly to side the glare is reduced dramatically and detection is significantly better
