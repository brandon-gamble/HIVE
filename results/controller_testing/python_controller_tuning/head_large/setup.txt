for large rotation, insert the following line just below the line where head_rad is calculated:

# TEMP ADJUSTMENT TEMPORARY REMOVE FLAG
head_rad = head_rad + math.radians(15)


target is then placed offset to the right of tank. by offsetting heading, we are able to accomplish larger step than 1/2 FOV.
