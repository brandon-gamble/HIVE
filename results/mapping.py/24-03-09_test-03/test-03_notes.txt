important note: heading is dependent on pixel location and cam specs (resolution and FOV). look at setup images and note spacing of lines of -15, 0, and +15:

distance | spacing
------------------
   300   |   77
   175   |   42


while lines are much closer, they are still spaced 15 degrees, and therefore they are captured by camera they have nearly identical pixel locations of approx 200, 320, and 400




for T03-01, center marker is 40mm square, adjacent markers are 20mm square. all markers are 20mm in depth

for T03-02, markers are not uniform, but roughly 8mm X 20mm with 8mm depth
