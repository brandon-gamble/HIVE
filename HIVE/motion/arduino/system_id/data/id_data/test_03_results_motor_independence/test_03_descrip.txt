trying to see if relationship between analog write and motor rpm is independent of what command the other motor is receiving

for 00, both motors get identical commands
for 01, left gets stepping cmd val and right gets 250 continuously
for 02, left gets stepping cmd val and right is off 

results:
- difference between second motor running at 0 and 250 is about 10%
i.e. measured motor runs about 10% slower when second motor is driving at 250 as opposed to 0

- difference between second motor running equal and 250 is very small

conclusion:
- should run sys_id test with both motors driven equally
- motors are nearly independent
